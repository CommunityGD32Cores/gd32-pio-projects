/****************** USB FS PHY CONFIGURATION *******************************

 *                      FIFO Size Configuration in Device mode
 *
 *  (i) Receive data FIFO size = RAM for setup packets + 
 *                   OUT endpoint control information +
 *                   data OUT packets + miscellaneous
 *      Space = ONE 32-bits words
 *      --> RAM for setup packets = 10 spaces
 *          (n is the nbr of CTRL EPs the device core supports)
 *      --> OUT EP CTRL info = 1 space
 *          (one space for status information written to the FIFO along with each 
 *          received packet)
 *      --> Data OUT packets = (Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces 
 *          (MINIMUM to receive packets)
 *      --> OR data OUT packets  = at least 2* (Largest Packet Size / 4) + 1 spaces 
 *          (if high-bandwidth EP is enabled or multiple isochronous EPs)
 *      --> Miscellaneous = 1 space per OUT EP
 *          (one space for transfer complete status information also pushed to the 
 *          FIFO with each endpoint's last packet)
 *
 *  (ii) MINIMUM RAM space required for each IN EP Tx FIFO = MAX packet size for 
 *       that particular IN EP. More space allocated in the IN EP Tx FIFO results
 *       in a better performance on the USB and can hide latencies on the AHB.
 *
 *  (iii) TXn min size = 16 words. (n:Transmit FIFO index)
 *
 *  (iv) When a TxFIFO is not used, the Configuration should be as follows:
 *       case 1: n > m and Txn is not used (n,m:Transmit FIFO indexes)
 *       --> Txm can use the space allocated for Txn.
 *       case 2: n < m and Txn is not used (n,m:Transmit FIFO indexes)
 *       --> Txn should be configured with the minimum space of 16 words
 *
 *  (v) The FIFO is used optimally when used TxFIFOs are allocated in the top 
 *      of the FIFO.Ex: use EP1 and EP2 as IN instead of EP1 and EP3 as IN ones.
